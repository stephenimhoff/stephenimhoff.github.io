Four Big Baseball Questions
==========

This report is an exploration of baseball data recorded on every single Major League game played from 1871 to 2016. 

This data was found on data.world and was compiled by Retrosheet. It consists of 171908 rows and 161 columns, each recording various stats about each game played. Of this massive data set, I focused on offensive statistics and pitching statistics to answer four major questions. Data manipulation to clean and prepare the data involved extracting the year from the date attribute and creating dozens of aggregations around attributes to study. There are numerous structural issues with the data. First, the players who played in 1871 and those who played in 2016 are playing different games entirely (see Fig 1 and Fig 2 in appendix). The way data was recorded changed fundamentally, strategies and rules have changed, and players have gone from day laborers playing on the weekends to professional athletes earning hundreds of millions of dollars today. Other issues were prevalent, such as the data not being extremely well suited to some types of analysis. The data set does not include individual player statistics and so any analysis of individuals is flawed. Note that all supplemental data was found on Baseball-Reference.com.
This report examines four questions:
1.	Is there a statistically significant difference in hits per game between the National League (NL) and the American League (AL)? This question is particularly pertinent as the NL this year considers adopting a Designated Hitter like the AL which should theoretically increase offense output.
2.	Does more pitchers used in a game by a team correlate with better performance by that team? Modern baseball strategy is increasingly requiring more and more pitchers to be used from the bullpen to get through the opposing lineup. Is this actually a good idea?
3.	How can runs scored by a team be best predicted? (Or, how many runs are certain occurrences worth?) In doing this analysis I can identify the most important traits for a hitter to have and what statistics teams should focus on.
4.	Can I identify and cluster quality starting pitchers from the dataset based on the pitching statistics of the game? It is difficult to differentiate between the quality of pitchers in watching a baseball game. It’s difficult to tell if a strikeout is the pitcher performing well or the hitter poorly, so I will quantify pitching performance.

The methodologies are:
-------
1.	T-test-involved isolating the NL and AL games and separating them into two bins, then doing a t-test to see if there was a statistically significant difference in the total hits per game between the two leagues. The ggplot library was used to test for normality in the dataset. All code is in the appendix. Review lines 18-66 for this first question.
2.	Correlation test/matrix-involved removing all rows with null values, measuring the correlation and creating a correlation plot to measure individual elements of pitching performance, such as walks, strikeouts, and hits. The correlation plot required the corrplot library. See lines 66-107.
3.	Linear Regression and Model Selection- involved creating a list of statistics to measure and ran a linear regression to see how many runs each statistic created. Regression and model selection required the leaps library. Ran this model with home pitchers as well as away pitchers to validate the results. See lines 109-135.
4.	Clustering-involved aggregating various pitching statistics around the home pitcher’s name and clustering the name of the pitchers based on their performance. This was initially done with all pitchers from 2007 onward which was far too many pitchers to make anything of. Then, 12 pitchers were selected with various levels of fame and success and were clustered based on their performance. Clustering required the NbClust library. See lines 136-191.

Question 1
--------
For the first question, I am examined the offensive difference between the NL and AL by assessing total hits by league. A new dataframe was constructed with calculations for total runs, home runs (hrs), and hits in a game added to the original dataset. Hrs and runs were used to get a “feel” for the data while I will be using hits to compare the AL and NL. Then, using aggregate(), the average hits by year was calculated. I added a new column with a value of 1 for NL and 2 for AL and added it to the hits data so the resulting table looked like this:

![test](https://github.com/stephenimhoff/stephenimhoff.github.io/blob/master/images/Table1.JPG?raw=True)

A t-test was done to see if there is a significant difference between the mean total hits and the two leagues. The mean AL hits is 17.97 and mean NL hits is 17.82 with a p value of 1.043e-07, indicating high levels of significance even though the difference is slight. A test for normality looked good:

![test](https://github.com/stephenimhoff/stephenimhoff.github.io/blob/master/images/fig5.JPG?raw=True)

The implied reason for the difference is the AL’s use of a designated hitter instead of having pitchers hit who are notoriously bad hitters. A potential reason why the averages are close is the AL didn’t adopt the DH until 1973 even though it was founded in 1901, meaning there is lots of data where the games were played essentially the same way. 

Question 2
--------
For the second problem, I am challenging the modern assertion that using more pitchers in a game is better at limiting the opposing team’s offensive performance. First, all NA values were omitted from the data set. The variables I am assessing to measure pitching performance are hits, strikeouts, hit by pitch, and walks. (A pitcher hitting a batter is generally a mistake and should be avoided, as with walks and hits. Strikeouts are good, meaning more strikeouts is better). Using the princomp() function, the correlation between number of pitchers used and hits of the opposing team is only .33 and the correlation between pitchers used and strikeouts is .345 (averaging the away and home pitching performance). This weak correlation indicates that using more pitchers is perhaps less effective than modern baseball thinking suggests. A correlation plot was made using all of those variables to see if there is any significant correlation between number of pitchers used and performance. 

Pitcher Correlation Plot
--------
![test](https://github.com/stephenimhoff/stephenimhoff.github.io/blob/master/images/pitcher%20correlation.JPG?raw=True)

While this chart is hard to read, the first two rows are v_pitchers_used and h_pitchers_used, meaning the visiting team and the home team. The strongest correlation was between these two variables rather than any performance metric. There didn’t seem to be any significant correlation between using more pitchers and better performance. 

Question 3
--------
The third problem is assessing which model is best to predict number of runs scored in a game by a particular team. The assessed variables using regsubsets() were visiting pitchers used, visiting errors, visiting balks, visiting passed balls, home stolen bases, home hits, home walks, home intentional walks, home hrs, and home strikeouts. The most significant factors (using 6) were pitchers used, errors, hits, walks, hrs, and strikeouts. The model created by lm() was runs scored = -2.4 + .2*pitchers used+ .5* errors + .5*hits + .3*walks + .85*homeruns - .08*Strikeouts. I recreated this model from the perspective of the visiting team and flipped the team of all of the variables and the results were nearly identical. You can see both models on lines 129-130. This model is confusing because a home run is only worth .85 runs, but a home run is also a hit. This means a home run is worth roughly 1.35 runs, which is feasible.

Question 4
--------
The fourth problem is meaningfully clustering pitchers based on their performance. I will be checking the results of this clustering against their wins above replacement (WAR), considered a holistic measure of a player’s value. I began by attempting to just cluster pitchers from 2007 on using aggregate(), dist(), hclust(), and scale(). The clustering is based on the opposing team’s score, hits, doubles, triples, hrs, hit by pitch, walks, and strikeouts. The resulting cluster was far too messy to read with a monitor of my size because it encompasses hundreds of starting pitchers (cluster viewable in appendix as Fig. 6). As an alternative, I used all of the data but only selected 13 pitchers to compare. This clustering was much more successful. 

Pitcher Clustering
----------
![test](https://github.com/stephenimhoff/stephenimhoff.github.io/blob/master/images/pitcher%20cluster.JPG?raw=True)

I intentionally chose pitchers who were known for being incredibly good as well as pitchers I had never heard of. Here is their ranking in the order of their clustering and by Average WAR

![test](https://github.com/stephenimhoff/stephenimhoff.github.io/blob/master/images/pitcher%20ranking.JPG?raw=True)

The clustering did a decent job of arranging the pitchers by their value. The one major correction was AJ Burnett who’s ranking was off by 7 positions. Other than him, the greatest variation was by 4 places. There are also only slight differences in WAR between the 7 best pitchers so any clustering variation is understandable.

I learned that R can easily create meaningful and interesting answers to questions I have. The AL, I found, has slightly more hits per game than the NL. The NL adopting the designated hitter will likely even that difference going forward. I will miss seeing pitchers with no business holding a bat strike out pitifully (or hit bombs, see appendix for an example). The second problem had disappointing results and wasn’t able to show a correlation between more pitchers and better performance. If a pitcher is left in for a while, it’s because they are doing well. If your pitchers are always being substituted, generally they aren’t performing well. This phenomenon may explain the low correlation. Also, the pitcher rotation phenomena developed in the last 5-10 years (see fig. 7 in appendix) meaning the data needs to be studied with greater focus on the last few years. I was able to validate the accuracy of the importance of hrs in modern baseball thinking as they are worth 1.35 runs versus the average .5 runs for the average hit. One conclusion is that a line-drive hitter needs to get at least three hits for every home run the power hitter can club to be more valuable. I was unable to satisfyingly cluster pitchers based on performance. The best pitchers were all grouped together but there were a few outliers. A huge issue with this clustering is the performance data was tracked from the entire game, not just when that pitcher was pitching. For future analysis, this clustering should only use statistics from when that pitcher was on the mound because the data is being skewed by the bullpen’s pitching as well. To better improve upon all of these results, more data should be analyzed more specifically. Instead of looking at all time periods, examining specific time periods and comparing players in their day instead of across time periods will be more precise.
