My name is Stephen Imhoff and I am currently a member of the Emerging Leaders Program in Treasury Services at BNY Mellon in Pittsburgh. I graduated Spring 2021 from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Finance, a minor in Computer Science, and a certificate in Business Analytics. 

I love working collaboratively and using big data, machine learning, and my financial accumen to improve efficiency and help people. My goal is to obtain my Masters degree and become a Data Scientist. For more information, please check out my CV, or reach out to me personally!
